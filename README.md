Simulation of a TRIGA-reactor using OpenMC and Monte Carlo method

By Soufiane El kabil, Anass Issad and Issam Chourak
By using Fortran 90

In this project, we will simulate a TRIGA (Training, Research, and Isotopes Production General Atomics) reactor using OpenMC and Monte Carlo method. The TRIGA reactor is a popular research reactor, which is widely used for various applications such as research, isotope production, and neutron activation analysis.

The Monte Carlo method is a powerful tool for simulating complex systems, such as nuclear reactors. In this project, we will use OpenMC, a widely used open-source Monte Carlo particle transport code, to simulate the neutron transport in the TRIGA reactor. We will use the continuous energy cross-section library to simulate the neutron transport.

The simulation will involve the modeling of the TRIGA reactor core, including its fuel elements, control rods, and other components. We will also model the neutron source, which is a key component of the reactor. The simulation will be validated against experimental data to ensure its accuracy.

The results of the simulation will provide valuable insights into the behavior of the TRIGA reactor under different conditions. This information can be used to optimize the design and operation of the reactor, as well as to improve our understanding of nuclear reactors in general.

Overall, this project will provide an excellent opportunity to gain experience in nuclear reactor physics, Monte Carlo simulations, and the use of OpenMC.
